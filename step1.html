            I remember when I was about eight or nine, I had a pet. It was my first pet, actually, and it was a little
            budgie called Ollie. I named her Ollie because it was the year of the Olympics … I can't remember which year
            it
            was. But this bird was really unusual because, quite quickly she became very tame. And I used to come home
            from
            school and I'd pick her up off whatever she was perching and I'd take her upstairs and she'd sit on the side
            of
            the bed. I don't know what actually happened to her because one day, we all got so used to just her being
            round
            the house, that one day my mother came in with some washing, the back door was open, and she just flew off
            and,
            er, we never found her again. It's a bit sad, really …

            The boat started floating out towards the sea and also, at the same time, the weather changed. It became
            very
            windy and the sea got choppy and we were quite scared. So, when we looked in the boat, the radio didn't
            work, so
            we couldn't ask for any help. We thought we were gonna be stuck here all night because we had no way of
            contacting anybody. But in the end, it was OK because my girlfriend managed to find the telephone number of
            the
            people who gave us the boat, so, after about half an hour maybe, they came and rescued us, but at the time
            it
            was, er, we were very worried and very scared.

            It was a time when I was really frightened and it was about two years ago, when I was on holiday in Sicily.
            And
            one afternoon we decided to hire a boat to go and sail round the coast. It started off quite nicely, it was,
            the
            sun was shining and, you know, we were sunbathing. <br> But then we decided to drop the anchor and stay
            still
            for a
            little while, but I didn't know that you shouldn't use the engine when the anchor is dropped. So somehow the
            rope got tangled up in the engine and the engine stopped working.
